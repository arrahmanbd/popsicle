# 🚀 I Am Planning to Change This System

## Key Notes

* **Dependency Injection adds too much boilerplate**
  Most state management libraries require DI or explicit bootstrapping, which slows down development in large apps.

* **Service Locator is not the answer**
  While service locators can reduce boilerplate, they introduce hidden global state and an *extra layer of dependency* to manage.

* **A new approach: simplicity first**

  * No explicit bootstrapping required
  * No additional DI frameworks or locators
  * Easy-to-use state management out of the box
  * Designed for **enterprise apps** without sacrificing developer experience

---

## 🔍 Why This Matters (Compared to Others)

* **Provider** → Too implicit, hard to trace dependencies in big apps
* **Bloc** → Predictable but verbose; boilerplate grows with app size
* **Redux** → Powerful, but overkill for Flutter; DI/configuration heavy
* **Riverpod** → Flexible, but still requires dependency wiring and provider overrides

👉 **Goal:** Keep the **predictability and scalability** of these systems, but remove the friction of DI and setup.

Got it 👍 — here’s a polished **vision statement keynote** for your **Hyperstate roadmap**, written like you’re pitching it to a dev team or enterprise stakeholders:

# Popsicle 2.0: Rethinking State Management

## 🎯 Vision Statement

State management in Flutter has matured, but enterprise apps still face one recurring pain: **unnecessary boilerplate from Dependency Injection and bootstrapping**.
Hyperstate aims to **streamline the developer experience** by removing these obstacles while keeping **predictability, scalability, and performance** intact.

---

## 🚩 The Problems With Current Solutions

* **Provider** → Simple at first, but dependency tracing becomes messy at scale.
* **Bloc / Cubit** → Strong patterns, but boilerplate grows fast in enterprise apps.
* **Redux** → Powerful and testable, but over-engineered for Flutter, requiring heavy setup.
* **Riverpod** → Flexible and modern, yet still tied to dependency wiring and overrides.

All of them rely on **DI or Service Locators** in some form, adding hidden complexity and friction.

---

## 🌟 Popsicle 2.0’s Roadmap

* **No DI, No Bootstrapping** → State is available without extra configuration.
* **Zero Hidden Dependencies** → No need for service locators or global state hacks.
* **Modular by Design** → Each feature owns its state and can be tested in isolation.
* **Enterprise Ready** → Middleware, persistence, observability, and lifecycle support built-in.
* **Developer Friendly** → Minimal ceremony, maximum productivity.

---

## ✅ My Mission

To create a **state management system** that is:

* As **predictable** as Bloc
* As **flexible** as Riverpod
* As **lightweight** as Provider
* And more **developer-friendly** than all of them

Without the baggage of **dependency injection** or **service locator workarounds**.
